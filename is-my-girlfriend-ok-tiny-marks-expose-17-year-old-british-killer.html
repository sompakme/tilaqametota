No mother should ever hold the cold hand of her murdered child. That is wrong. That is disgusting. That is horrific," Carole Gould told The Sun.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The pair, who had met in high school, had only been dating for three months before he became "possessive" and murdered Gould.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/NERO-Yo0yhLOAIUuZbiJ3WVfz04=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/52KZ5JEG4RW3CSKRDX5JTO3BME.jpg"><p>They had known each other for several years before they became a couple. Griffiths was Gould's first boyfriend.</p><p>And while she was "flattered" he had asked her out, the teen's mother said they were never a good match.</p><p>"There was just nothing remarkable about him, he was really quiet. He had dinner with us and he didn't have a lot to say for himself. But it was her first boyfriend and we assumed it would fizzle out," she told The Sun.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>However, on the night of May 3, 2019, Griffiths brutally murdered Gould, using her finger to unlock her phone and text her friends to try to make it look as if she had killed herself.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Telltale signs</h2><p>Griffiths initially tried to claim he hadn't been near the family's Wilshire house, a county in south-west England, but marks on his face were telltale signs for investigators.</p><p>Gould, who had hopes of joining the police force, was studying for her trial exams when Griffiths knocked on her door.

I haven't seen her today,'" Taylor said.</p><p>"So he is immediately already trying to lay the foundations down of his lies and deceit."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/mrXtjFAuXpgvl1qG4JJTu0x4G4k=/16x10/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/RUUJD6PRESQIVOTWRRVJ2A63EU.jpg"><p>Griffiths stabbed Ellie multiple times in the neck before disposing of a number of items in the woods and going back to school.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>He also sent a chilling text with a selfie to a group of friends explaining he "scratched" himself out of stress.</p><p>"I think everyone noticed that I've been rly [sic] down lately and I need to tell you why," Griffiths' text read.

All I could think was Ellie had cut herself because he doesn't like the sight of blood."</p><p>However, after initially thinking her death was a tragic accident, police later told the heartbroken family Ellie had been murdered.</p><p>Griffiths, who was arrested two days later, eventually pleaded guilty, but refused to explain why he took Gould's life.</p><p>He was sentenced to 12-and-a-half years behind bars in November 2019 – six months after the murder - but he is eligible to apply for a review after serving half his sentence if he can prove good behaviour.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Carole Gould has previously said he should serve at least 17 years – equal to her daughter's age – given his lack of remorse.</p><p>"We as Ellie's parents want answers from Griffiths - how could he carry out such an evil brutal murder on our beautiful, kind, caring, gentle Ellie who he was supposed to have been fond of and why did he do it?" she said.</p><p>Carole Gould is now campaigning for victims of domestic violence in the UK.</p><p><strong>WHERE TO GET HELP</strong></p><p>• <a href=#>0800 543 354 (0800 LIFELINE) or free text 4357 (HELP) (available 24/7)</a><br>• <a href=#>https://www.lifeline.org.nz/services/suicide-crisis-helpline</a><br>• <a href=#>YOUTHLINE</a>: 0800 376 633<br>• NEED TO TALK?
