They were chosen — after extensive reporting and consultation with stakeholders at every level of entertainment, as well as key members of inclusion-centered industry groups like Time’s Up and ReFrame — for their active leadership and mentorship: These are the producers, execs, creators, stars and advocates making content, making hires and making noise for those still finding their voice. Adds Rhimes, “Good men fix broken things.” So meet the good men (including some straight white dudes), good women and one nonbinary person who are leading the way.</p><p>Profiles written by Tara Bitran, Kirsten Chuba, Ashley Cullins, Rebecca Ford, Lesley Goldberg, Mia Galuppo, Natalie Jarvey, Rebecca Keegan, Borys Kit, Michael O’Connell, Alex Ritman, Bryn Elise Sandberg, Tatiana Siegel and Rebecca Sun.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom2/Banners/THR_empowerment-embeds2x.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11><h2>Stephanie Allain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom2/Banners/THR_empowerment-embeds2x.png><p>As a Columbia executive in the 1990s, she helped launch the careers of directors like John Singleton, and the indie producer's film and TV projects have always showcased black characters, from 2005's Hustle & Flow (nominated for two Oscars and winner of one) to this year's Alfre Woodard starrer Juanita. She's also fought to give women their shot, including cinematographers Tami Reiker (Beyond the Lights) and Amy Vincent (Hustle & Flow) and editors Cindy Mollo (Juanita) and Terilyn A. Shropshire (Beyond the Lights). For Netflix series Dear White People (based on the 2014 Sundance film she executive produced), she has leaned heavily on female directors, from Nisha Ganatra to Janicza Bravo (both are now feature helmers with hot careers). But the 59-year-old New Orleans native is accustomed to bold ventures, having sold her home to make Hustle & Flow.

Executive vp production Alonso, 53, sits on the studio's greenlight committee alongside Kevin Feige and Louis D'Esposito and believes that "the world is ready" for a queer superhero. "It's one of the most important things when we can identify ourselves in the cast or the crew of these films," says Alonso, who is gay. "It's part of your identity's journey." But it's also healthy for the bottom line, as the $2.3 billion generated by Panther and Captain attests (with another big sum in the offing from Endgame). "It makes business sense, it makes social sense and for me, makes personal sense," says Alonso. Moore is the production vp who pitched Feige on the idea of introducing Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War and chased Ryan Coogler to helm the character's genre-redefining stand-alone.</p><p><strong>EVERY STUDIO EXEC SHOULD SEE …</strong></p><p><strong>Alonso</strong> "The English Patient (love), The Official Story (politics) and [There's] Something About Mary (laughter)."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.5><h2>Kenya Barris</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/victoria_alonso_and_nate_moore.jpg><p>Moving from ABC to Netflix in 2018, Barris is upping the mentorship opportunities at his Khalabo Ink Society — as well as his creative output. The 44-year-old writer-producer has been ahead of the pack in terms of representation: His comedy Black-ish has been a critical and cultural boon for ABC, while spinoff Grown-ish provided a platform for breakout Yara Shahidi. On the features side, Barris' credits include 2017 hit Girls Trip, which he co-wrote, and producing work on Little. The loose spin on Big opened to a strong $15 million and minted 14-year-old star Marsai Martin as the youngest executive producer ever on a studio feature.</p><p><strong>MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF UNCONSCIOUS BIAS I'VE EXPERIENCED IN HOLLYWOOD</strong><strong> </strong>"When I was an assistant working for a showrunner early in my career, he would read scripts one way when he thought the writer of the script was white. And when he discovered they were black, I would literally hear him read the script in a 'black' vernacular and intonation. He wasn't a racist. He wasn't a bigot. This was just his natural, programmed default. It was so shocking that it prompted me to change my first writing name from Kenya Barris to K.

And it wasn’t until I spoke to one of my daughter’s friends that I realized the singularly proprietary and groundbreaking impact that Lena has. Her fearless and raw transparency in letting the world see who she is has given permission for a lot of other queer kids to be seen. It’s often hard for me to give her credit — because every time I see her she gives me shit about how much more successful she is than I am — but there is no denying Lena is a cultural icon and a trailblazer who has made her mark on this place in a way we won’t soon forget."</p><p><strong>EVERY STUDIO EXEC SHOULD SEE … </strong>"Do The Right Thing, Swingers, and All In The Family."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Lorrie Bartlett</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kenya_barris-publicity-h-2018_0.jpg><p>Bartlett isn't on the list because she's the first black board member (as of January) of a major talent agency. It's because she is determined not to be the last. "My job is to help create a pathway that is filled with fewer potholes than I had," she says. Bartlett — who grew up wanting to be a librarian or a football coach — does this by mentoring ICM's junior employees (she threw her support behind an assistant's idea to stage an agencywide luncheon during Black History Month) and "linking arms with my fellow agents and executives who are trying to effect change" in creating a pipeline for underserved groups. As one of ICM's growing corps of black female agents — a group that also includes veterans Andrea Nelson Meigs and Dana Sims — she helped organize the annual Phenomenal Women dinners that gather black female execs from across the industry. "Our jobs are to be beacons," she says.</p><p><strong>WHO'S REALLY DRIVING CHANGE IN HOLLYWOOD?</strong> "Ava DuVernay, who walks it like she talks it.

"You don't want to be the reason that five other movies don't work," Berlanti, 48, says of the love story about a "white gay kid and a black Jewish gay kid." It's just one example of the prolific (15 shows on the air) creator's dedication to LGBTQ inclusion: He cast trans activist/actress Nicole Maines as TV's first transgender superhero on The CW's Supergirl; showrunners under his employ (such as Riverdale's Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa) also make LGBTQ characters a priority. Berlanti, who mentors up-and-comers like his former assistant (now a director of production at Berlanti Productions), has been recognized by the Trevor Project and GLAAD, among others.</p><p><strong>I'LL KNOW HOLLYWOOD HAS TRULY CHANGED WHEN …</strong><strong> </strong>"The majority of rooms I walk into — executive suites or writers rooms or production floors — look and feel like the rest of America."</p><p><strong>WHO'S REALLY DRIVING CHANGE IN HOLLYWOOD?</strong> "We worked with Ava DuVernay on CBS' The Red Line and she set a whole new standard when she came in and started doing the show.

Maude. Sanford & Son. Good Times. The Jeffersons. One Day at a Time — then and now. Lear, 96, was the first, but with collaborators like Calderón Kellett, 44, he knows he won't be the last storyteller to push for inclusion. "I wouldn't know how to live any other way," says Lear, founder of the Imagen Awards and Media Access Awards. "Inclusion was a family in our neighborhood up the street, across the street, down the street." Of all his sitcoms, Lear "can't remember being involved with a show with more positive reaction from the media" than the ODAAT reboot he made with Calderón Kellett (herself an active mentor to writers trying to break into Hollywood). "Being able to tell the story of a Latinx, immigrant family, a real American family, in an honest way heals the kid in me that never got to see that," she notes, adding that the show's writing staff is half Latinx, half LGBTQ and half female. Although Netflix canceled ODAAT after three seasons, Calderón Kellett and Lear remain optimistic as conversations continue that the series will forge on after a deal with CBS All Access fell through (see guest column, page 48). "The fact that we were trending on Twitter, that's all you want. They care. They want more," she says.

"Our goal in the long term is to become invisible," says the nonprofit's chairman Chen, 32, who works alongside 22 other volunteers (among them, Joy Luck Club producer Janet Yang and Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin) when he isn't busy with his stealth new accelerator. "We want to create a culture where Asians support Asians, period." In addition to hosting regular salons, Gold House's most tangible and visible work has been supporting Asian-led films including Searching and Minding the Gap at the box office by buying out theaters. The so-called #GoldOpen movement, which in February struck a partnership with AMC Theatres, helped Crazy Rich Asians rake in $26.5 million during its three-day North American debut last August.</p><p><strong>WORST SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERIENCE</strong> "Opening Facebook at any time, anywhere and scrolling through circular political debates and faux-modest self-adulation.

Jordan. Cheng, 48, who also serves as COO for the studio, says the Culver City-based group created a diversity task force around three years ago, designed to make sure that Amazon's staff and its original projects were reflective of the e-commerce giant's base of 100 million-plus Prime members. "We hold ourselves to a very high standard," notes Cheng, who also serves on the board of the Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment. For Sanders, 49, who joined Amazon in spring 2018 from NBC, it was work he already was committed to, having advocated that his former employer make a financial commitment to supporting diversity in front of and behind the camera. He notes: "In some cases, the network covered the cost of adding new series regulars to shows to make the difference."</p><p><strong>WHO'S REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN HOLLYWOOD?</strong></p><p><strong>Sanders</strong> "I've been impressed with how Lena Waithe's company has launched multiple series with dynamic points of view.

From optioning a Thai cave rescue movie for the sole purpose of making a point ("I wanted to send out a signal that said, 'There are people in Hollywood who have the full support of a studio to protect the perspective of a story and how it's told.' ") to amplifying Latinx narratives with his next project, Warner Bros.' adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda's In the Heights, representation has become a driving passion. "The power of people talking to me about their experience of seeing themselves on the big screen has changed my whole perspective," he says.

If his freshman effort, Fruitvale Station, established him as a directing talent and Creed proved his ability to handle studio fare, then the $1.3 billion Marvel blockbuster solidified his position as a Hollywood powerhouse. Panther led to Oscar wins for costume designer Ruth E. Carter and production designer Hannah Beachler, the first black women to win in their respective categories. While he gears up for the sequel, Coogler, 32, is also throwing his weight behind other projects headed by black creatives, which includes producing both a Space Jam remake, with Random Acts of Flyness creator Terence Nance set to direct (Coogler is co-writing with Searching scribe Sev Ohanian), and Shaka King's Fred Hampton movie Jesus Was My Homeboy.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=20.5><h2>John Cooper, Keri Putnam, Kim Yutani</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ryan_coogler_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg><p>In her first year as director of programming, Yutani, 49, put her stamp on the 2019 fest's lineup, shining a light on culturally specific filmmakers (in perhaps a first, Warner Bros. showed up at the fest and bought Blinded by the Light, a drama about a Muslim teen in '80s England). Festival director Cooper, 62, helped shape a competition lineup that featured 42 percent female directors, 39 percent people of color and 23 percent who identify as LGBTQIA (a nod to Yutani's "desire to see the world from as many points of view as possible"). But it all starts at the Institute, which Putnam, 53, heads up.

Longoria, who co-founded Eva's Heroes to provide enrichment programs for young adults with special needs in her hometown of San Antonio, also made a concerted effort to not just hire "another Tom, Dick, or Harry" as her director of photography, but instead corralled females across the board from DP to stunt coordinator to editor.

Gearing up for a screen adaptation of his first Broadway hit, In the Heights, Miranda recalls how the show arose from knowing "exactly how many roles there were for Latinos in the musical canon and that I wouldn't work unless I wrote." Currently in development on The Kingkiller Chronicle, Sony's Vivo and Disney's The Little Mermaid remake, Miranda is excited by the fantasy genre's lack of boundaries, noting Mermaid will be more diverse than the original animated film.

Accepted applicants get training, mentorship and, in success, placement in writers rooms, assistant positions for the likes of Jada Pinkett Smith and even on agency desks. "You have to learn," says the creator of Showtime's The Chi and BET's upcoming Twenties, emphasizing the importance of workshops for aspiring writers. "You can't just sit around and go to panels."</p><p><strong>EVERY STUDIO EXEC SHOULD SEE …</strong> "Better Things, the first season of The Comeback and an independent film called Just Another Girl on the I.R.T."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.5><h2>Alan Yang</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/lena_waithe.jpg><p>As the co-creator of Netflix's Master of None alongside Aziz Ansari, Yang brought into existence the first Asian-led auteur-driven comedy, a genre previously popularized by swaths of white men. The showrunner, whose Maya Rudolph/Fred Armisen series Forever debuted on Amazon in September, has several projects that will brighten the spotlight on people of color, particularly immigrants. Two of his upcoming creations — Apple's Little America and Netflix's Tigertail (his film directorial debut) — will tell such stories. He may not be a household name yet, but Yang, 35, has used every platform he has to explicitly advocate for inclusion, like the time during his 2016 Emmy acceptance speech when he pointed out the lack of Asian American characters onscreen and called on parents to "get your kids cameras instead of violins."</p><p><strong>WHO'S REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN HOLLYWOOD?</strong> "I want to shout out all of the Asian actors who have been holding it down for decades. Tzi Ma, who's one of the leads in Tigertail, has been acting since the '70s. Can you imagine how unconscionably stereotypical and horrible some of the roles he was auditioning for back then were? I want to thank them for sticking it out and hope that over the next couple of decades we can make up for all of the bullshit they probably had to put up with."</p><p><strong>EVERY STUDIO EXEC SHOULD SEE …</strong> "Do The Right Thing, Spike Lee; In the Mood for Love, Wong Kar Wai; Persona, Ingmar Bergman."</p><p><strong>MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF UNCONSCIOUS BIAS I'VE EXPERIENCED IN HOLLYWOOD</strong> "At one point in a meeting, an executive looked at me and the person I was pitching with — who was not white — and said, 'What is it like when you go into a bar looking like this?' and then moved his hand over his face — to imply a different race, I guess?"</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.821201413428><h2>Nina Yang Bongiovi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alan_yang.jpg><p>Since launching Significant Productions with Forest Whitaker in 2010, Yang Bongiovi has been crystal clear in her focus: "We want to produce multicultural films and television and normalize people of color onscreen so it doesn't become a niche." She has produced such indie darlings as Dope, Songs My Brothers Taught Me, Fruitvale Station and Sorry to Bother You, helping to launch the careers of directors Rick Famuyiwa, Chloé Zhao, Ryan Coogler and Boots Riley. Coming up, Yang Bongiovi, who mentors a female USC student of color every semester, is teaming with Netflix on a live-action film featuring predominantly Asian American kids. Plus, she and Mimi Valdés launched Metta Collective in 2016, which mentors young filmmakers of color through workshops and other events.</p><p><strong>BRAVEST CAREER RISK I'VE TAKEN</strong> "Rallying the financial support behind Boots Riley's Sorry to Bother You, and putting my and Forest's reputation on the line to back such a revolutionary filmmaker. It was all or nothing … no middle ground."</p><p><strong>WHO'S REALLY DRIVING CHANGE IN HOLLYWOOD?</strong> "Barry Jenkins. His beautiful works of art inspire filmmakers and storytellers that bigger isn’t necessarily better. Excellence rises to the top."</p><p>A version of this story first appeared in the April 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
