He was the teenage standout freestyle swimmer in 50, 100, and 400 meters.</p><p class=align-left>He aimed at representing the United States of America at the 1992 Olympic Games.

He was a bright student in class, so he put more attention into his education.</p><p class=align-left>He only developed an interest in basketball in ninth grade after his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">brother-in-law encouraged</a> him to try it out.
