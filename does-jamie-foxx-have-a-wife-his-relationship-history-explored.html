The pair first sparked dating rumours in 2013 but avoided publicly mentioning their romantic involvement. In 2015, a photo was leaked in which the two held hands in the studio in Jamie’s house. The photo reignited the rumours, causing the actor to address them finally.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking to ET's Nancy O'Dell, he denied the <a id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2VcKESJTfk" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating rumours</a>. He explained that they were friends and that Katie’s ex, James Van Der Beek, was also present that night. It took three more years before the pair finally confirmed they were a couple. They announced this by appearing together at the Met Gala in 2018.</p><p class=align-left>Even after the official announcement, the couple kept their relationship details private. Fans speculated that Katie preferred a low profile because of her previous tumultuous and controversial <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/biographies/1526571-tom-cruises-wives-actor-married-years/ href=#>marriage to Tom Cruise</a>.

In August 2019, the actor was spotted looking cosy with a mystery blonde and singer Sela Vave in a span of two days.</p><p class=align-left>Foxx quickly responded to these claims, stating that he and Vave were just friends. He explained that he had taken Vave under his wing to help her with her <a href=#>music</a> career and that they were working together.
