Two days after that, the car was found and social media quickly became aware: neighbors began live streaming and posting pictures of the police towing the two-door, white Mercedes Benz, which they located in the driveway of a home just three miles from the crime scene.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Thanks to those images and videos, fans were able to then match the house from where the getaway car was parked with the same house in a </span><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>music video filmed by Memphis artist Straight Drop</span></a><span> called “Going Straight In.” This later led to the theory that he is responsible for Dolph’s murder (more on this below).&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2><strong>Relocation of Makeda’s Cookie Shop</strong></h2></p><p><h6>Justin Ford/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Dolph was gunned down at Makeda’s Cookies-- a shop he loved and visited every time he came back to the city. Since the shooting, the owners have yet to reopen the Airways location, where the incident occurred. Instead, it has become a shrine where both fans and family have been leaving memorabilia to honor Dolph.&nbsp;With this location out of service, Makeda’s&nbsp;re-opened in a brand new spot in downtown Memphis. The operations manager, Raven Winton, told </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>Fox 13 Memphis</span></a><span>&nbsp;that the shop plans to honor Dolph in a more permanent way, by naming his favorite cookie– chocolate chip-- after him.</span></p><p><h2><strong>Mia Jaye’s Tribute</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Mia Jaye, 32, was Dolph’s life partner. She mothered both of their kids-- Tre and Aria Thorton. Since Dolph’s passing, Jaye has deleted all photos from her Instagram except those with him in them. The three&nbsp;posts&nbsp;that remain live on her page each showcase a memory&nbsp;of her late husband.&nbsp;In <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her most recent post</a>, shared on Christmas <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Eve</a>, she reminisced about how much Dolph loved the holidays, while issuing a thoughtful warning:&nbsp;"For every man considering to take another mans’ life, think of the holes you will tear in the heart of their family."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Mia is also the founder of Black Men Deserve to Grow Old, a foundation that advocated for the lives of black men. Since&nbsp;her partner's&nbsp;passing, the company has&nbsp;released clothing that features an image of Dolph’s face as well as their slogan on the front.</span></p><p><h2><strong>Key Glock Grieves</strong></h2></p><p><h6>Prince Williams/Wireimage/Getty Images<strong><br></strong></h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Not only were Key Glock and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Dolph</a> coworkers, they were also cousins. Glock did not immediately respond to the news of Dolph’s death right away, leaving fans anxious in his wake. A few days after the shooting, he took to his Instagram story to say, "STOP asking me if I’m ok Knowing d**n well I ain’t…"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Five days after Dolph’s death, Glock posted ten images on Instagram of him and his late cousin. His caption stated, “Damn bro, I’m lost. My heart is torn, my brain bout to explode, it HURTS when I breathe.. Why you leave me so soon??”</span></p><p><h2><strong>Street Named After&nbsp;Dolph</strong></h2></p><p><h6>SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>On December 15, 2021, the city of Memphis renamed the area of Dunn near Airways and Hayes to Adolph “Young Dolph” Thornton Jr. Avenue. The street resides in Castalia Heights, where the rapper spent his childhood. The rapper’s family, friends, and fans gathered as the black and gold street sign was unveiled to honor his legacy. His aunt, Rita Myers, said to </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>Action News 5</span></a><span>, “Adolph brought resources and revenue to Memphis. When he did his massive videos, they were done in Castalia. They were done in South Memphis. He brought revenue to this city.”</span></p><p><h2><strong>FedExForum Memorial</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A day after receiving his street sign,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a “Celebration of Life” memorial</a> was held at the FedExForum in Memphis on December 16, 2021. While his close family and friends had their own service for Dolph, this event was opened to the public. Tickets to the service sold out in 90 minutes. There were thousands of fans who lined up to pay their respects to the legend. The celebration included remarks from his loved ones as well as special performances from people signed under his label.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Though unrelated to Dolph’s case, outside of the Forum at the memorial, </span><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>police arrested three men</span></a><span>. One was arrested for driving a stolen Infiniti Q40. The other two, Guyland Key and Antwon Flynn, were arrested for attempting to flee the scene after driving their car into a pole.&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2><strong>Blac Youngsta vs. Grove Hero</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Grove Hero is a comedian and philanthropist from Memphis, Tennessee. He is known for his numerous business endeavors and his funny personality. He is also a representative under Dolph’s label, Paper Route Empire, and so they&nbsp;were very close.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Blac Youngsta, meanwhile, had a long-standing beef with Paper Route Empire. After Dolph turned down the offer to be signed to CMG, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Yo Gotti</a>’s label, Blac Youngsta seemingly honed in on the beef. When Dolph was shot at over 100 times in Charlotte, Youngsta turned himself into authorities for playing a part in the shooting.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since then, Youngsta dropped a music video to a song called, “I’m Assuming.” In the video, he can be seen in a cemetery standing in front of a tombstone with the last name Thorton. Fans speculate that this was done intentionally as a way to mock Dolph’s death.</p><p><h2><strong>Justin Johnson Wanted for Murder</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Justin Johson, also known as Straight Drop, is a rapper from Memphis who is now the main suspect in the murder of Dolph. Fans speculated that he had ties to the shooting once&nbsp;they recognized that the location of the getaway car was featured in his music video for "Going Straight In" (the video has since been taken off the internet)-- and&nbsp;they were ultimately proven correct. On January 5, 2022, the Memphis Police Department issued a first-degree murder warrant for Johnson. They promised a $2,500 reward for&nbsp;information that would lead to his&nbsp;capture. He was also placed on the Most Wanted List and is considered to be armed and dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Johnson posted a message on his Instagram Story days later, seemingly confirming he would turn himself in:&nbsp;"Turning myself in Monday @201 I’m innocent. I’ll be back sooner than you can blink." 201 refers to 201 Poplar, which is the men’s jail in Memphis, TN.&nbsp;</span></p><p><h6><span>Screenshot via @straightdroppp IG</span></h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite promising to surrender himself on January 10,&nbsp;the fledgling artist&nbsp;dropped a music video instead, titled "Track Hawk," and has since disappeared from Instagram, with his account now disabled or deleted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There is some sort of history between Johnson and Dolph, although the exact details are unclear. Johnson, 23, was spotted in the background of a picture with Young Dolph taken in 2018. Even though the two were seen together, Johnson obviously felt some type of animosity, as, when he caught wind of the picture that same year, he took to Facebook to state, "They needa scratch my face out this s**t." Photos have also surfaced of Johnson posing with a PRE (Paper Route Empire) chain. However, according to rumors in Memphis, the chain was stolen from one of Dolph’s artists.</p><p><h2><strong>Young Dolph Tribute Album</strong></h2></p><p><h6>John Lamparski/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The first single,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> by rapper Jay Fizzle, is titled “LLD.”</a>&nbsp;Played over a somber piano beat, Fizzle raps, “I f****d up plenty times, but you ain’t never threaten to cut me off. Always had my back and everybody knew I wanted to be like Dolph.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>While Dolph’s murder isn’t officially solved yet, it seems a lot of progress has been made. Now a month and a half since his death, and authorities, alongside help&nbsp;from his most loyal fans, have been able to identify their main suspect.&nbsp;Let's hope the story continues to unravel from here, and Dolph's family is able to get some closure.</span></p><p><h2><strong>Arrests Made</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>As of yesterday, Tuesday, January 11, two suspects have been arrested&nbsp;in connection with&nbsp;Young Dolph's murder. Justin Johnson was found by U.S Marshals at around 3 PM ET in Indiana, on January 11, and he now faces charges of first-degree murder and theft of property between $10,000 and $60,000. There is a second suspect, Cornelius Smith, who was also booked and indicted according to&nbsp;Shelby County District Attorney's office.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Smith reportedly shot at Dolph's brother, who was inside Makeda's Cookie Shop with Dolph. Smith faces charges for&nbsp;first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, convicted felon in possession of a firearm, employment of a firearm in the commission of a dangerous felony, and theft of property over $10,000.</span></p><p><h2><strong>Third Suspect Arrested</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As of January 12, 2022,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a third suspect has been arrested</a> in connection with Dolph's murder.&nbsp;Shundale Barnett was the latest suspect to be apprehended in Indiana, and he had reportedly been helping fellow suspect and would-be rapper Justin Johnson evade the police. Barnett will face charges for accessory after the fact to first-degree murder, criminal attempt to commit first-degree murder, and theft of property between $10,000 and $60,000.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Long Live Dolph.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjbYR0f5JmsKitnpx6pbvLqZ9mq12ZsqLAx2aYZqyZorKttc2eZKieXZrDprrTrGSnnaeo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-everything-that-s-happened-since-young-dolph-s-death.html&text=Here%27s%20Everything%20That%27s%20Happened%20Since%20Young%20Dolph%27s%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-everything-that-s-happened-since-young-dolph-s-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-everything-that-s-happened-since-young-dolph-s-death.html&title=Here%27s%20Everything%20That%27s%20Happened%20Since%20Young%20Dolph%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-everything-that-s-happened-since-young-dolph-s-death.html&title=Here%27s%20Everything%20That%27s%20Happened%20Since%20Young%20Dolph%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-everything-that-s-happened-since-young-dolph-s-death.html&title=Here%27s%20Everything%20That%27s%20Happened%20Since%20Young%20Dolph%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-everything-that-s-happened-since-young-dolph-s-death.html&description=Here%27s%20Everything%20That%27s%20Happened%20Since%20Young%20Dolph%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-are-newport-cigarettes-in-pennsylvania.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Are Newport Cigarettes In Pennsylvania">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./every-song-justin-bieber-and-selena-gomez-have-written-about-each-other-jelena-songs-about-each-ot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Every Song Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez Have Written About Each Other - Jelena Songs About Each Ot">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
