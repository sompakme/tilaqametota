For one thing, the chess prodigy's habit is kickstarted in her childhood due to the orphanage she is sent to after her mother's death; every day, the orphanage's residents line up to receive their "vitamins"—two pills, one red and one green. For another, throughout much of the series, the drugs seemingly help, rather than hurt, Beth's pursuit to become a chess grandmaster by "clearing her head" and allowing her to map out entire games on the ceiling of her room.<br></p><p>It doesn't take long for Beth (played in her youth by Isla Johnston) to get hooked on the green pills, which are eventually revealed to be tranquilizers. And while it seems that Beth's addiction will end with the laissez-faire attitude that allowed orphanages to drug their wards—barring her last-ditch effort to break into the medicine room to swallow as many of the leftover, now-illegal pills as possible—they reappear several years later. Beth's adoptive mother (Marielle Heller) relies on the drug, which she refers to as her "tranquility medicine," to deal with the stresses of her unfulfilled dreams and failing marriage. Beth, now played by&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a34426557/netflix-queens-gambit-anya-taylor-joy-interview/>Anya Taylor-Joy</a>, quickly begins siphoning out handfuls of the pills to keep for herself, plunging her immediately back into the throes of addiction.<br></p><p>So, what exactly&nbsp;are&nbsp;these orphanage- and mom-approved pills? Here's everything we know about the "green pills" in&nbsp;The Queen's Gambit.</p><h2 id=are-the-green-quot-tranquility-quot-pills-real-3>Are the green "tranquility" pills real?</h2><p>In the show, the pills are called Xanzolam, which is not a real drug. However, as&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.newsweek.com/queens-gambit-netflix-green-pills-librium-xanzolam-1542060 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Newsweek</a>&nbsp;reports, Xanzolam bears many striking similarities to chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine that was marketed as Librium. It became hugely popular in the 1960s, when&nbsp;The Queen's Gambit&nbsp;is set, and&nbsp;was packaged in two-toned green capsules similar to Xanzolam; in fact, at one point, when Beth is in Mexico City for a chess tournament and has run out of Xanzolam, she is given Librium at a local pharmacy. After being patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1960, Librium was prescribed liberally as a cure for anxiety, insomnia, and withdrawal symptoms. This widespread usage came to a head in the mid-1970s, when the DEA instated stricter regulations for Librium due to its overprescription and high potential for misuse.</p><p>These early tranquilizers were reportedly heavily marketed to young women and housewives who were physically healthy but, likely due to a sense of dissatisfaction with their positions in mid-20th century America, were struggling to cope mentally. Rather than supporting them in, oh, I don't know, securing financial independence or pursuing high-status careers outside of the home, physicians at the time instead offered them bottle after bottle of sedatives. Tomayto, tomahto.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NcqH35pHWFoHciphX4hFbA-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=where-did-the-idea-for-beth-apos-s-addiction-come-from-3>Where did the idea for Beth's addiction come from?</h2><p>Walter Tevis, who wrote the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a34483986/the-queens-gambit-true-story-beth-harmon/>1983 novel</a>&nbsp;on which the Netflix series is based, drew on many of his own experiences and relationships to build Beth's world, from his time as an amateur chess player to the many "brainy women" in his life. Beth's addiction to Xanzolam was no different. In an interview with&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;in 1983, Tevis described how writing about Beth's substance abuse helped him address his own experiences with drug use.</p><p>"When I was young, I was diagnosed as having a rheumatic heart and given heavy drug doses in a hospital. That's where Beth's drug dependency comes from in the novel," Tevis said. "Writing about her was purgative. There was some pain—I did a lot of dreaming while writing that part of the story. But artistically, I didn't allow myself to be self-indulgent."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
