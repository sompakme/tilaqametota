Of course, this isn't too surprising, as he often keeps the humor up during his concerts and loves to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">interact with fans in meaningful ways</a>. However, as the 6 God sang a slightly remixed version of "One Dance," it seems like he really just wanted fans to pipe down for a second rather than play into their energy. Specifically, a fan let out a shrill scream as he went through the chorus, which evidently caught his ears. With a side-eye towards the scream, whether out of concern or annoyance, Drizzy provided an online meme without skipping a singe beat of his performance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That being said, hopefully that scream was just a fan being excited and not actually in any distress. Either way, it made "One Dance" a bit funnier this time around. Actually, it's a bit of a shame that this happened during that track in particular, because whenever Drake switches a song up during these shows, it can make for a really cool and unique moment for fans who haven't seen him yet. At least you couldn't really notice it unless you were very, very close to him onstage.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-hilariously-shades-screaming-fan-with-one-cold-look>Drake Hilariously Shades Screaming Fan With One Cold Look</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, other fan interactions while on tour have been equally as notable and much more wholesome. For example, the 36-year-old spotted a fan in the front row that's already been to a couple of shows. After shouting her out, Drake clarified that she has a first-class ticket to Atlanta and a VIP stay at another concert of his, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">even offered her $10K to spend</a> while there. That's probably her money's worth for her many visits- and then some.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In other OVO news, For All The Dogs is still on the horizon for October 6, and "Slime You Out" is still getting heavy play. As such, maybe die-hards will clamor for another tour soon specifically centered around this project. Even though It's All A Blur wraps up just a couple of days after its release, we're sure that Aubrey Graham will treat fans to some early favorites from it. With that in mind, log back into HNHH for the latest news and updates on Drake.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZoJ4g5Zmm6uZm5p6tLXDnmSesZVis6K6jK2mrqpdmLyvr8Srq2agmaV6qbvPZqWer6M%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrake-s-side-eye-to-a-fan-in-the-crowd-hilariously-disrupts-performance-watch.html&text=Drake%27s%20Side-Eye%20To%20A%20Fan%20In%20The%20Crowd%20Hilariously%20Disrupts%20Performance%3a%20Watch&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrake-s-side-eye-to-a-fan-in-the-crowd-hilariously-disrupts-performance-watch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrake-s-side-eye-to-a-fan-in-the-crowd-hilariously-disrupts-performance-watch.html&title=Drake%27s%20Side-Eye%20To%20A%20Fan%20In%20The%20Crowd%20Hilariously%20Disrupts%20Performance%3a%20Watch" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrake-s-side-eye-to-a-fan-in-the-crowd-hilariously-disrupts-performance-watch.html&title=Drake%27s%20Side-Eye%20To%20A%20Fan%20In%20The%20Crowd%20Hilariously%20Disrupts%20Performance%3a%20Watch" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrake-s-side-eye-to-a-fan-in-the-crowd-hilariously-disrupts-performance-watch.html&title=Drake%27s%20Side-Eye%20To%20A%20Fan%20In%20The%20Crowd%20Hilariously%20Disrupts%20Performance%3a%20Watch" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrake-s-side-eye-to-a-fan-in-the-crowd-hilariously-disrupts-performance-watch.html&description=Drake%27s%20Side-Eye%20To%20A%20Fan%20In%20The%20Crowd%20Hilariously%20Disrupts%20Performance%3a%20Watch" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./heathrow-ground-handling-staff-suspend-strike-set-for-friday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heathrow ground handling staff suspend strike set for Friday">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./can-you-run-a-gas-hot-water-heater-without-electricity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can you run a gas hot water heater without electricity?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
