I'd rather be single allowing us to both be happy in our lives." He then suggests he loves both Rihanna and Karrueche <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">in a promo video</a>.&nbsp;"Is there such thing as loving two people?

It also cites that the two were experiencing problems due to Chris' "immaturity," spending more time partying than making music. However, a secondary source claims Chris was the one who ended the relationship, on account of Karrueche sending photos to other men and discussing Chris in interviews.</p><p><strong>August 17, 2014: </strong>The two <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">are spotted</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>being affectionate&nbsp;at a charity football game, and it's later reported that they're officially back together. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The source claims</a>&nbsp;that Karrueche was suspicious that Chris had hooked up with another woman at a yacht party, but now believed that he was in fact telling the truth about staying faithful.</p><p><strong>December 5, 2014:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">During Power 196's Cali Christmas</a>, Chris announces he's single, as well as exclaiming "fuck that bitch!" in reference to Karrueche.

I don't think social media is a place to air out or hash out personal problems and a nigga feel hella WACK for doing it. So I AM APOLOGIZING I live in a glass house and the same shit that makes me great also is my curse. Everybody know I love that girl.

The two went their separate ways after the argument.</p><p><strong>June 15, 2015: </strong>Chris Brown calls Karrueche out on Instagram for talking about him in interviews, to which Karrueche offered a level-headed response.&nbsp;</p><p>"First off @chrisbrownofficial you just did an interview w Ryan Seacrest in which you spoke about me," she wrote. "My interview w Access Hollywood was not entirely about you.. they asked a question and as a mature adult I answered. I'm not gonna shy away from something that I lived through. I'm talking about my life and experiences. I'm not speaking on you or bashing you (like I easily could). Don't be mad at me because our relationship is over due to your lack of loyalty.

Which is understandable, but it sucks, because I’m not a weak person,” she says. "I used to date him, and now as I am growing into myself and maturing and getting my career together, I am starting to have my own name without having to be associated ... I feel like I shouldn't have to explain myself to anybody because this is my life and I can do whatever I want.

In the lengthy comment, she suggests that she's happy doing her own thing in 2017, and calls the beef between Chris Brown and Soulja "makes no sense."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Shortly thereafter, Chris offered his own response to Karrueche.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That's all so far... will history repeat itself in 2017?
