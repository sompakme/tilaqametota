We are left with almost as many questions as answers.</p><p>Where was Mark for the five days he was missing, when it seemed the whole country was searching for him?</p><p>Jacoba turned up on Thursday and was admitted to hospital, dazed and agitated. From there she was transferred to a Goulburn mental health facility. But where had she been from the moment she left her husband, on the Tuesday, until she arrived in Yass two days later? And how did she get to Yass?</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-world">Related articles</h2><p>The mental health issues that have plagued the family have been a source of confusion as well.
