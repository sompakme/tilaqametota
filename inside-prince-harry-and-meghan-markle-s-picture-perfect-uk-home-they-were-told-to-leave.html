Harry's cousin Princess Eugenie also lived in the property when the couple moved to the US.</p><h2>Frogmore Cottage's kitchen</h2><p id=eyr2GLK4OP1 data-wc=30>In the couple's Netflix docuseries, a number of personal photographs were used, including a photograph of themselves inside the property's amazing <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>kitchen</a> </strong>in the teasing trailer, and we were blown away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/69aeca361948-frogmore-cottage-kitchen-z.jpg><p id=e4t8nikR0iIA data-wc=52>The photo allows fans to observe the sweet country-style kitchen almost in full, where the family have a massive marble-topped kitchen island with in-built cupboards and pendant lights hanging overhead. There are open shelves with hanging saucepans and cosy touches have been added to the cooking space including plants, flowers and artwork.</p><h2>Frogmore Cottage's bathroom</h2><p id=eA_QOog6uxIy data-wc=44>Another Netflix snippet gave an insight into bathtime with baby Archie when they were living at Frogmore. Archie can be seen reaching out of the bath with his hair wet from the tub while his proud parents looked on with smiles on their faces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8a24fbd165c9-bathroom-frogmore-z.jpg><p id=eDspYsY1FpmG data-wc=54>The little one was sitting in a roll top bath, the kind you'd commonly see in hotel rooms with vintage style taps at one end. Behind the Sussexes what appears to be a shower cubicle can be seen and there is also a glimpse of a vanity unit with fluffy towels hanging by it.</p><p id=eybn2FHZR5Wh data-wc=4>Frogmore Cottage's living room</p><p id=eVkbHBCSqurn data-wc=26>When Princess Eugenie lived there, she gave&nbsp;fans glimpses inside the property as she shares updates on her son – and she has clearly added some <a class=hm-link href=#>personal touches to the interiors.</a></p><p id=ea1t6P4FqxGL data-wc=52>In the living room, for example, Eugenie was pictured sitting on a cream sofa in front of a blue bookshelf. She was surrounded by colourful cushions, and among the red fluffy trimmed designs and intricate blue and white patterns was one small green cushion with the personalised message: 'August born in February.'&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/050d8835fb34-jack-brooksbank-living-room-z.jpg><p id=eo_pWs6mouTG data-wc=11><strong>Jack Brooksbank was pictured cuddling baby August in a neutral room</strong></p><p id=eOuwkRRN3xLi data-wc=38>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously moved into the&nbsp;home&nbsp;in April 2019, shortly before their son <a class=hm-link href=#>Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor</a> was born. They initally kept the property as their UK base after their decision to step back from royal duties.</p><p id=eEqrmwdcn28T data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's new £11million home is full of hidden references</a></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2e801f2d1afb-frogmore-cottage-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=eylun6P1V6nT data-wc=7><strong>Frogmore Cottage on the Queen's Windsor estate</strong></p><p id=e9SIeLuDxtEM data-wc=43>It’s situated in front of an incredible lake and Grade-II listed Frogmore House, where the royals&nbsp;hosted their wedding reception in May 2018. Inside, it is reported that there are five bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room and a nursery, formerly for Archie.</p><p id=eapXaV1sZ1u0 data-wc=23>The property had a whole renovation in 2019 costing the Sovereign Grant a reported £2.4million, and the couple then repaid back the money.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a263cd6e4a00-prince-harry-meghan-markle-frogmore-house-lake-z-z.jpg><p id=eqBbayUXe0Jb data-wc=11><strong>Frogmore Cottage backs onto Home Park, with 655 acres of gardens</strong></p><p id=eIZrJh-KhWYu data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son Archie's private playground will blow your mind</a></strong></p><h2>Frogmore Cottage's garden</h2><p id=e859nmQG7oXu data-wc=61>Outside, Meghan is also likely to have planted several of Archie's lemon-yellow&nbsp;namesake Chrysanthemums in the garden. Archie was granted the honorary flower as part of&nbsp;a tradition which dictates that royal family members&nbsp;receive a namesake variety of the flower, in a nod to the blooms that decorated Westminster Abbey on Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip's wedding day in 1947.</p><p id=e2KTvPvhfeWu data-wc=22>They also have a special tribute to one of their family members in the garden, in the form of a dog statue.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezewb4KPpGZ8 data-wc=5><strong>Baby August in the garden</strong></p><p id=ezz7r793OABa data-wc=51>Vicky's unique sense of style and what Meghan saw at the Soho House clubs may have also transferred into Frogmore Cottage. The clubs take design inspiration from the 1920s and 30s, with luxury furniture including velvet sofas and chandeliers, although Meghan and Harry will have of course made it their own.</p><p id=eArRGsIVETVJ data-wc=50>Vicky previously told Soho House, "Private homes are incredibly different. The clients come to us because they want the Soho House aesthetic but you have to make it right for that family or whoever lives there in their space, so it's not a cookie-cutter thing you can just drop in."</p><p id=ererdT1lj4rK data-wc=57>Both Harry and Meghan are also big art fans, with Harry having gifted Meghan a romantic canvas reading 'Everybody Needs Somebody to Love' by British artist Van Donna, during their courtship. The Queen is also believed to have given the couple a series of paintings from her own personal collection, which Eugenie and Jack can now enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXbsh8NdFDVJ data-wc=23><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbyusdJoaWlqY2WAcX6Qb2xwbWNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6ecyenqGZnmK6or7KpZxmnqKktK670Z5knKekqa6osYyipayhlJp6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-s-picture-perfect-uk-home-they-were-told-to-leave.html&text=Inside%20Prince%20Harry%20and%20Meghan%20Markle%27s%20picture%20perfect%20UK%20home%20they%20were%20told%20to%20leave&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-s-picture-perfect-uk-home-they-were-told-to-leave.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-s-picture-perfect-uk-home-they-were-told-to-leave.html&title=Inside%20Prince%20Harry%20and%20Meghan%20Markle%27s%20picture%20perfect%20UK%20home%20they%20were%20told%20to%20leave" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-s-picture-perfect-uk-home-they-were-told-to-leave.html&title=Inside%20Prince%20Harry%20and%20Meghan%20Markle%27s%20picture%20perfect%20UK%20home%20they%20were%20told%20to%20leave" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-s-picture-perfect-uk-home-they-were-told-to-leave.html&title=Inside%20Prince%20Harry%20and%20Meghan%20Markle%27s%20picture%20perfect%20UK%20home%20they%20were%20told%20to%20leave" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-s-picture-perfect-uk-home-they-were-told-to-leave.html&description=Inside%20Prince%20Harry%20and%20Meghan%20Markle%27s%20picture%20perfect%20UK%20home%20they%20were%20told%20to%20leave" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joe-pepitone-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joe Pepitone Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-do-i-know-which-walmart-credit-card-i-have.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Do I Know Which Walmart Credit Card I Have">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
