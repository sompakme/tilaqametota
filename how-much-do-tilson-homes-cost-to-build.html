If you want pipes installed around your new home, you can expect to spend at least $12,000 (and maybe more).</p><h3>Is it more cost-effective to buy or build a house?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>If you are purchasing an existing property, you should consider the following: The current median cost of purchasing a single-family home is $223,000, according to the most recent statistics.
