The rumor mill continued churning out theories when SZA made a surprise cameo in Scott’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kS7F4VpJa0" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="video for “K-pop,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">video for “K-pop,”</a> featuring the Weeknd and Bad Bunny, in July.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Neither SZA nor Scott, however, has said anything publicly about their rumored relationship.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Kehlani (2021)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gossip swirled in 2021 that SZA and Kehlani were maybe romantically linked, when the pair <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/kehlanidaiIy/status/1437759796367736834 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="were seen holding hands" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">were seen holding hands</a> as they walked into Rihanna’s Met Gala after-party in September.

Kehlani, on the other hand, came out as a lesbian in April 2021, through <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2021/music/news/kehlani-comes-out-lesbian-tiktok-1234958397/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a TikTok video" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a TikTok video</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two appear to have remained friends through the years. However, when SZA released her second studio album, SOS, in December 2022, and fans were theorizing online that Kehlani had likely been asked to appear on it, but couldn’t get a verse to SZA in time, Kehlani <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00197124.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=responded class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">responded</a> on TikTok. “I WISH I GOT ASKED WTF 😂,” they said.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Unnamed ex-fiancé (2008—2019)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although she’s never revealed his name, SZA was engaged to a fashion designer (rumored to be Scott Sasso), whom she met when she was right out of high school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The “Drew Barrymore” singer first alluded to the relationship in a 2023 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/sza-sos-deluxe-grammys-drake-snooze-video-1234830913/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rolling Stone</a> cover story. “When we talk, she doesn’t divulge her ex-fiancé’s identity, though she describes him as a fashion designer who doesn’t post on social media,” writer Mankaprr Conteh repoted. “They became unengaged five or six years ago, [SZA] says, having been together for a total of 11 years and engaged for five. I do some quick maths and conclude that they must have started dating around the time she was in high school. ‘I was fresh from high school,’ she concurs.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">SZA let a tad more information slip <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc0vRDh1ECA" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in an interview" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">in an interview</a> a couple of months later with Zane Lowe for Apple Music. During this chat, she revealed that her ex was the reason she’d started seriously pursuing music in the first place. “[I] really only did music to prove a point,” she said. “When I started making music, it was to my ex-fiancé, because he was paying for everything. My food, my clothes, where I lived—and he was eight years my senior, so I was so codependent.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Things don’t seem to have ended super amicably between the pair, because this is the same ex SZA <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.complex.com/music/a/markelibert/sza-exposed-her-cheating-ex-boyfriend-during-london-concert data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shaded during a concert" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">shaded during a concert</a> at London’s O2 Arena in London in 2023. As she opened her song “Nobody Gets Me,” the St. Louis native told a story about a cheating ex before calling out her former fiancé: “I never told anybody, but like, my boyfriend cheated on me in this city before. It was terrible. That’s why I was really sad to come here, but you guys made it so much better. Thank you! This song is about my other trash ex-boyfriend.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9cCfTjx0Qo" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="interview with Hot 97" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">interview with Hot 97</a> in December 2022, SZA discussed the difficulty of breaking things off with her ex, and how it inspired <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNd_ufPG3x4" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Nobody Gets Me.”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Nobody Gets Me.”</a> “This particular song in entirety is a story about my ex-fiancé and how we went through all these arguments, and we broke up,” she said. “And when we first broke up, it was like terrible, and I just felt like I was gonna be doomed to be in hell for the rest of my life, because nobody understood me the way he did, and nobody motivated me the way he did.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Drake (2009)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Almost a decade and a half before she appeared on his 2023 track <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_gLD1jarfU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Slime You Out,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Slime You Out,”</a> SZA and Drake had a fling, in 2009.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">SZA first <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/sza/status/1312942896576782337 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="addressed the brief relationship" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">addressed the brief relationship</a> in 2020, after Drake’s lyrics on his guest appearance on 21 Savage and Metro Boomin’s “Mr. Right Now” raised some eyebrows: “Yeah, said she wanna fuck to some SZA, wait / ’Cause I used to date SZA back in ’08 / If you cool with it, baby, she can still play.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a34271472/sza-drake-dating-confirmed/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="set the record straight" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">set the record straight</a> on Twitter, writing, “So It was actually 2009 lol 🙃.. in this case a year of poetic rap license mattered 🥴 lol I think he jus innocently rhymed 08 w wait . Anybody who really knows me and was around during this time can confirm.. it’s all love all peace 🤝💎💫.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a tweet in the same thread, SZA added, “I just didn’t want anybody thinking anything underage or creepy was happening . Completely innocent . Lifetimes ago .” (For context, SZA would’ve been 18 for most of 2008, whereas Drake would’ve been 21.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Apparently, SZA did unfollow Drake on Instagram following the release of “Mr. Right Now,” at least according to a report at the time from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/music/drake-claims-dated-sza-new-song-21-savage/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>, which suggested she wasn’t pleased by the reference.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A couple of years later, though, she commented on her present-day relationship with Drake during an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl_m_FiJJyh/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="interview with Audacy" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">interview with Audacy</a>. “We’re cool, we’ve always been cool,” she said. “It’s never been weird.
