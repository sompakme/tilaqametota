The Lauren Silverman Simon Cowell affair caused a media frenzy because, at the time, Lauren was a married woman.</p><p class=align-left>Silverman was born as Lauren Davies in New York City to parents Steven Davies and Carole Eisenberg. She has one younger sister, Nicole Alexandra. Nicole and her sister grew up in the lap of luxury as their father was an affluent man.

She was born on 1st January 1977.</p><h2>Lauren Silverman net worth</h2><p class=align-left>The brunette beauty has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth of</a> $10 million. Not much is known about how she came into this amount. Some outlets, however, have claimed that she received a $2 million <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">payout after her divorce</a> from ex-husband Andrew Silverman.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99de8993dc8bee7a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alice Goodwin biography: who is Jermaine Pennant’s ex-wife?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52778d4dd79324aa.png><p class=align-left>After the divorce - that was caused by the Simon Cowell Lauren Silverman liaison - <i>TMZ </i>reported that she would pay Andrew a $50,000 penalty if her boyfriend approached their son.

She had been pregnant with Simon's child at the time. The divorce papers stated 'adultery' as the reason for the dissolution. The broken-hearted and scorned husband named Simon as the other person in the affair. Lauren kept her husband's name after the divorce.</p><p class=align-left>On 14th February 2014, the New York socialite gave birth to her second son, Eric Cowell. Eric is Simon's first and only child. The news of the pregnancy came as a surprise to many as just a couple years before; the <i>X Factor</i> judge had said that he had no <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">desire to have children</a>.</p>God, no. I couldn't have children. If I had them here drawing on the walls, I'd go nuts.<p class=align-left>After Eric was born, the TV host's tune changed, and he could not stop talking about the positive change that his son and the mother of his child brought into his life.
