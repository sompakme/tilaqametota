As of September 2020, Mark Wiens age is 34.</p><h2>Where are Mark Wiens parents from?</h2><p class=align-left><a id=https://thenetline.com/people/mark-wiens/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mark was born</a> to a Chinese mother and an American dad. As such, Mark Wiens ethnicity is mixed. His parents were missionaries, and that meant that he moved around a lot as a child.</p><h2>Education</h2><p class=align-left>Mark attended the first year of school in the tiny town of Albertville, France. He was then home-schooled for three years in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p class=align-left>He then attended an international Christian school (Rosslyn Academy) in Nairobi, Kenya, after his family moved to the East African country in 1996.</p><p class=align-left>From 5th grade, all the way up through graduating from high school in 2008 (with the exception of 1 year back in the US), he attended Rosslyn Academy.</p><p class=align-left>He did eventually return to the Valley, taking classes at Glendale Community College for a year before transferring to Arizona State University, where he graduated in 2008 with a bachelor's degree in Global Studies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4b6ab3628019e8eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kevin Mimms (Miles) biography: age, height, parents, wife, salary</span></p></a><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Mark's fascination with food was always there since he was young. When Mark's family lived in Congo, he would go into the jungle and try out wild fruits, berries, and even insects.</p><p class=align-left>When he moved to Kenya, Mark enrolled in an international school, and it gave him more opportunities to try out food from different parts of the world.</p><p class=align-left>During Mark's university years, his hunger to learn more about the world and eat more delicious food grew.</p><p class=align-left>In 2008, right after graduating, he set off to travel through South America on a solo trip with few plans. He ended up taking a TESOL certificate course to teach English. A few months later, he returned to the US to attend his sister's wedding.</p><p class=align-left>It was during that time, back in early 2009, when he decided to start a blog.

The website provides information on mouth-watering food while inspiring people to get out of their comfort zone, setting goals and pursue their passion.</p><p class=align-left>Mark was not yet ready to get a job and stay put, so he caught a one-way ticket to Bangkok, with no plans other than to eat as much as he could.</p><p class=align-left>After traveling around Southeast Asia for about six months, he spent nearly all his money. He was in the Philippines at that time, and he caught a flight from Manila to Bangkok.</p><p class=align-left>At this point, he decided to get a job teaching English, and it did not take long before he signed a contract to teach English for a year.</p><p class=align-left>However, teaching English was not for him; although it was a great experience, it just wasn't his passion.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f22d343a4a469b79.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michael Richards bio: Most exciting details about Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During that year, he set a personal goal that he would never teach again and that he would find a way to make a living on the internet, so he could travel (and eat) and earn money at the same time.</p><p class=align-left>Mark used his free time to start his food blog.
