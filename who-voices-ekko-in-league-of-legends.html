In our interview, we discuss League of Legends, the importance of a young Black character like this, and how he feels about Arcane season 2.</span></span><h2>Is Ekko voiced by Zuko?</h2>Voice Actor For Ekko In Arcane LoL<p>Miles Brown has done the voice-over for the character of young Ekko in Arcane. But the voice actor for older Ekko is Reed Shannon.</p><h2>How old is Ekko in League of Legends?</h2>During his release, it was stated that Ekko was a 16-17-year-old teenager.<h2>Who sings for Ekko in true damage?</h2>Thutmose, the voice actor for True Damage Ekko, said today that he'll be taking part in a “collab” with Riot Games on Saturday, Dec.<h2>Who voices Pyke League of Legends?</h2>Gideon Emery is an English actor and singer.<h2>Behind the Scenes | Giving True Damage Ekko a Voice</h2><p></p><h2>How old is ekko True Damage?</h2>Ekko Facts:<p>– Ekko is 16-17-years-old, making him possibly born in 20o2 or 2003.</p><h2>Is Ekko in love with Jinx?</h2>Ekko also has multiple voice lines in various games that suggest he had a deeper friendship with Jinx. In League of Legends, his taunt toward an enemy Jinx is, “I had a crush… until you started talking to the gun.” In Legends of Runeterra, he reacts to an allied Jinx being summoned with the line, “man…<h2>Who is older Ekko or Jinx?</h2>Ekko is a little older than Jinx, I think he's like 19-20. After Vander died he went around helping Silco's victims until they had a little rag tag crew of people like him who wanted to help. They found the tree and were able to slowly expand into the Firelights.<h2>Is Ekko and Jinx friends?</h2>Ekko and Jinx were childhood friends in Zaun and were the two youngest among Vi and the others. As children, the two were close.<h2>Is Ekko a girl?</h2>Ekko is an energetic, spunky young boy who grew up in the town of Zaun.<h2>Why is Jinx named Jinx?</h2>Jynx/jinx is traced to the 17th-century word jyng, meaning "a spell", and ultimately to the Latin word iynx, also spelled jynx, as 'j' and 'i' are the same letter in Latin.<h2>Why does Ekko have an hourglass on his face?</h2>His cognitive age does not change over the course of rewinding. Zero-Drive are both shaped after an hourglass, an expression of his personality as well as the symbol he adopted for himself.<h2>Is General Iroh Zuko's son?</h2>Iroh (or in easier terms Iroh II) is a supporting protagonist in the Nickelodeon cartoon series The Legend of Korra. He is the commander of an army called the United Forces of his First Division as well being the the grandson of Zuko from the original series Avatar: The Last Airbender.<h2>Who voices older Ekko in Arcane?</h2>Reed Shannon is the voice of Ekko / Firelight Leader in Arcane.<h2>Why are Jinx's eyes red?</h2>Jinx's Eyes Are a Sign Of Her Mental State<p>However, her eyes do become pink in certain moments when she is undergoing severe stress. The most striking example is when Jinx shoots down the Firefly who she thought was her sister Vi.</p><h2>Why did Ekko and Jinx fight?</h2>But Marcus betrays Caitlyn, forcing Vi to return; this convinces a spying Jinx that Vi has thrown her lot in with Caitlyn. Jinx detonates a number of robotic insect-like bombs, killing Marcus and the enforcers and injuring Caitlyn. Ekko fights Jinx to give Vi and Caitlyn time to escape.<h2>Who is Ekko's dad?</h2>His parents, Inna and Wyeth, vowed to provide a good future for their son—Zaun, with all its pollution and crime, would only stifle Ekko, whom they felt deserved the wealth and opportunities of Piltover.<h2>Who is Jinx boyfriend lol?</h2>The protagonist of the series is Jinx — one of the most popular champions in League of Legends. Among all the fans, there was one person that seemed to love the character more than others: Sonwooang, a talented artist that enjoys drawing League of Legends characters.<h2>Are Jinx and Lux friends?</h2>While Jinx scoffs at protecting a world she doesn't trust, she does believe in her childhood friend Lux—and if someone could see into the depths of Jinx's heart, they'd see a furious, burning need to keep those she holds dear out of harm's way, at any cost.<h2>Who is Jinx boyfriend Arcane?</h2>One of the biggest surprises to come out of Arcane is by and large the incredibly beautiful relationship between Jinx, the loose cannon champion who is one of League's most famous characters, and Silco, the fearsome crime lord of Zaun who has never been playable in League but who quickly became one of Arcane's ...<h2>Did Ekko rewind time?</h2>Ekko shatters his timeline, becoming untargetable and rewinding to a more favorable point in time. He returns to whenever he was a few seconds ago, and heals for a percentage of the damage received in that duration.<h2>What Ekko says?</h2>"Fool me once… and I'll just rewind." "I hate being responsible." "My pasts have a way of catching up." "I'd rather make mistakes than make nothing at all."<h2>Who does the voice of teemo?</h2>Otani Ikue (Pikachu from Pokémon), will be voicing Teemo. Kugimiya Rie (Alphonse from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood), will be voicing Annie. Uesaka Sumire (Anastasia from Cinderella Girls), will be voicing Jinx.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaun56wpr%2BMnqKkp12eu264xJqerp1dpLNuuMSgnKecow%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-voices-ekko-in-league-of-legends.html&text=Who%20voices%20Ekko%20in%20League%20of%20Legends%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-voices-ekko-in-league-of-legends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-voices-ekko-in-league-of-legends.html&title=Who%20voices%20Ekko%20in%20League%20of%20Legends%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-voices-ekko-in-league-of-legends.html&title=Who%20voices%20Ekko%20in%20League%20of%20Legends%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-voices-ekko-in-league-of-legends.html&title=Who%20voices%20Ekko%20in%20League%20of%20Legends%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-voices-ekko-in-league-of-legends.html&description=Who%20voices%20Ekko%20in%20League%20of%20Legends%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wil-wheaton-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wil Wheaton Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-goose-and-what-is-a-flerkin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Goose and What Is a Flerkin?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
